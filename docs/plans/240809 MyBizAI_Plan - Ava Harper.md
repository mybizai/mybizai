looks good, but a couple adjsutments needed...See attached file on beta tesiing, we will be able to develop platforms and do marketing concurently, we are working with AI Agents only, so that will speed things up significantly, the marketing will all be organic and not paid advertising, at least during the bootstrap phase, our only costs will be running systems, as we are building and training our on LLM, we will get Startup Credits from MIcrosoft to the tune of $100-$150K, and possibly simular from GCP and AWS <<<that's our scaling costs, out of pocket costs will be negligable until MyMarket (which i assume ws Market-Me), the first platform is launched. we will iterate and overlap the development, beta testing, marketing and system load tesing/scaling, as well as othere areas, and save launch times there. being first to market is essential!!! another competitor is LEGACY Marketing Agencies, with flesh workers who are stuck in the "old school" paridigms of marketing, we can capitalize with companies utilizing those who will need to ADAPT to the quickly changing way of doing business nowthat AI has landed and help them into the paridigm shift...we need to market with passing that message, ADAPT or go out of business...the new way has arrived! DOn't write anything yet, i have to upload that file...give me a sec!

Great, I'll wait for you to upload the file so we can incorporate those details into the final plans. Let me know when it's ready!
