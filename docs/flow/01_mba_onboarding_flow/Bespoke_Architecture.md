# **The MyBizAI Bespoke Architecture Proposal**

Objective: To present the client with a set of dynamically generated, bespoke engagement models. We are not selling "Tiers"; we are presenting "Architectures."  
Vibe: A Partner presenting a strategic plan to a Board Member.

## **1\. The Transition: From "Gift" to "Proposal"**

**Context:** The client ("Chase") has just reviewed the free "Market Opportunity Snapshot" (the "Value Drop").

Marcus (Strategic Director):  
"Chase, I hope you found that 'Snapshot' valuable. It's a clear indicator of the market gaps we can exploit.  
Based on that data, and everything we discussed in our Deep Dive, I have convened with the team. We have architected three potential engagement models for you.

These are not 'packages.' They are three distinct **Organizational Blueprints**, each designed for a different level of speed and autonomy.

Shall we review them?"

*\[User clicks "Proceed"\]*

## **2\. The Presentation: The Three Strategic Paths**

The interface presents three clear, elegant options. They are named based on the user's goal (e.g., "Explorer Path," "Accelerator Path," "Empire Path").

### **Path 1: The "Foundation" Architecture**

**(The "Gold" / Advisory Model)**

* **The Vibe:** "We build your strategy; you execute it."  
* **The Promise:** "We will architect your entire business model, brand, and go-to-market strategy. We hand you a complete, step-by-step playbook, and your Director (Marcus) stays on as a high-level advisor to monitor your progress."  
* **The Team (Visualized):**  
  * **Marcus** (Strategic Director) \- *Active*  
  * **Theresa** (Market Research) \- *Active (Strategy Only)*  
  * **Arthur** (Finance) \- *Active (Modeling Only)*  
  * **Anthony** (Legal) \- *Standby*  
  * **MySalesAI** \- *Standby*  
* **Autonomy Level:** Low. The team provides the *plans*, the client provides the *labor*.

### **Path 2: The "Accelerator" Architecture**

**(The "Platinum" / Hybrid Model)**

* **The Vibe:** "We build *and* run your growth engine."  
* **The Promise:** "We architect the strategy, and we also **autonomously execute** your entire sales and marketing stack. MySalesAI will run your outreach. Theresa's team will run your ads. You just approve the strategy and watch the dashboard."  
* **The Team (Visualized):**  
  * **Marcus** (Strategic Director) \- *Active*  
  * **Theresa** (Marketing) \- *Fully Autonomous*  
  * **MySalesAI** (Sales) \- *Fully Autonomous*  
  * **Arthur** (Finance) \- *Advisory Mode*  
  * **Anthony** (Legal) \- *Standby*  
* **Autonomy Level:** High (in specific, pre-defined areas).

### **Path 3: The "Full Enterprise" Architecture**

**(The "Diamond" / Fully Autonomous Model)**

* **The Vibe:** "We run your entire business. You are the Chairman."  
* **The Promise:** "This is the 'C-Suite as a Service.' We handle everything: Sales, Marketing, Finance, Legal, HR, and Operations. You are free to focus 100% on high-level vision, M\&A, and product innovation. Your Director (Marcus) acts as your full-time COO."  
* **The Team (Visualized):**  
  * **Marcus** (Strategic Director) \- *Active*  
  * **All Departments** (Sales, Marketing, Legal, Finance, HR, Ops) \- *Fully Autonomous*  
* **Autonomy Level:** Total.

## **3\. The "Spectacular" Element: The Interactive Team Charter**

This is the "Unnecessarily Spectacular" moment. After presenting the three paths, Marcus invites the client to *customize* their chosen architecture.

Marcus:  
"Chase, I personally recommend we start with the 'Accelerator' Architecture. It provides the best balance of speed and investment.  
But this is not a one-size-fits-all solution. This is *your* team.

Let's look at the Charter."

**The Interface:**

The screen shows an org chart with "Chase" at the top, "Marcus" just below, and the various "Departments" (Theresa, Anthony, Arthur) as direct reports.

Next to each department is a **Dynamic Toggle**:

* **\[Theresa (Marketing)\]**: \[ **ADVISORY** | **AUTONOMOUS** \]  
* **\[Anthony (Legal)\]**: \[ **STANDBY** | **ADVISORY** | **AUTONOMOUS** \]  
* **\[Arthur (Finance)\]**: \[ **ADVISORY** | **AUTONOMOUS** \]

The "Honest Price" Interaction:  
A dynamic price is displayed: Bespoke Retainer: $3,800/mo  
Marcus:  
"You'll notice your price is $3,800/mo. That's because I've only activated the Marketing and Sales teams, with Finance on 'Advisory.'  
Watch this. If you decide you *also* want Anthony's team to handle all your legal contracts autonomously, simply toggle him to **'AUTONOMOUS'**."

*(Chase clicks the toggle. The price instantly re-calculates to **$4,650/mo**.)*

Marcus:  
"The price is a direct reflection of the workload you assign to your team. You are in complete control of your architecture, and you can scale it up or down at any time.  
Shall we authorize the **'Accelerator'** team and get started?"
