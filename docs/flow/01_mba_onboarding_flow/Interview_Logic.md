# **The MyBizAI Interview Logic & Scripting**

**Objective:** To intake the client, identify their specific need, demonstrate value through "Team Cameos," and deliver a high-value insight document *before* asking for the sale.

## **Path 1: The Explorer (No Idea / High Intent)**

Target: The "Second Act" individual or the Aspiring Founder.  
The Pre-Quote Deliverable: "The Market Opportunity Snapshot" (A 3-page PDF analyzing 3 niches that fit their profile).

### **The Script Flow**

**Marcus:** "Excellent. We have a blank canvas. My goal is to find the intersection between your experience and high-yield market trends. I don't want to build you a job; I want to build you an asset."

Question 1 (The Asset Check):  
"To narrow down the sectors, tell me: In your previous career, what was the one skill people consistently praised you for? Was it managing logistics, selling a vision, or perhaps technical precision?"  
Question 2 (The Lifestyle Check):  
"Are you looking for a 'High-Touch' business where you are interacting with people daily, or a 'Low-Touch' digital asset that runs quietly in the background?"  
The Cameo (Theresa \- Head of Market Research):  
Marcus: "One moment. I'm going to ping Theresa. She tracks emerging micro-markets. Theresa, based on Chase's background in \[User Input\] and desire for a \[Low-Touch\] model, what sectors are lighting up in Q3?"  
Theresa: "Hello Chase. We are seeing massive volume in specialized e-learning and niche affiliate networks for that demographic. I've flagged those for your report."  
The Value Drop:  
Marcus: "Chase, Theresa just compiled a 'Market Opportunity Snapshot' for you. It outlines three sectors where your specific skills give you an unfair advantage. I’ve placed it in your secure tray. Take a look, and then we can discuss the team needed to build one of them."

## **Path 2: The Architect (Has Idea / Needs Execution)**

Target: The Founder with a napkin sketch or a prototype.  
The Pre-Quote Deliverable: "The Viability Stress-Test" (A Red/Yellow/Green light report on their concept).

### **The Script Flow**

**Marcus:** "Building something new is the most exciting phase. My job is to ensure we don't just build a product, but a sustainable business model around it."

Question 1 (The Problem):  
"In one sentence, what is the expensive or painful problem your concept solves for your customer?"  
Question 2 (The Edge):  
"Why hasn't a competitor solved this yet? Is it a technology gap, or a service gap?"  
The Cameo (Anthony \- Head of Legal/IP):  
Marcus: "That is a distinct angle. I want to be careful here. Anthony, can you run a quick query on recent trademark filings in that specific niche? I want to make sure the road is clear."  
Anthony: "Checking now, Marcus... The sector is crowded, but that specific naming convention appears clear. I would recommend we secure the IP early."  
The Value Drop:  
Marcus: "Chase, based on what you've described, I've had the team generate a 'Viability Stress-Test.' It breaks down the potential barriers to entry and the estimated capital requirements to get an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) live. It’s in your tray now."

## **Path 3: The Optimizer (Existing Business / Scaling)**

Target: The SMB Owner drowning in chaos or hitting a revenue plateau.  
The Pre-Quote Deliverable: "The Operational Health Audit" (A diagnostic showing where they are losing money/time).

### **The Script Flow**

**Marcus:** "Understood. You have traction, but you want momentum. We need to identify if your bottleneck is 'Sales' (not enough cash) or 'Operations' (too much friction)."

Question 1 (The Bottleneck):  
"If you stepped away from the business for 30 days, specifically what would break first? Would sales stop coming in, or would the delivery of the service fall apart?"  
Question 2 (The Data):  
"Do you currently have a consolidated dashboard where you can see your P\&L and Lead Cost in real-time, or are you pulling that from different spreadsheets?"  
The Cameo (MySalesAI \- Head of Revenue):  
Marcus: "I have a suspicion about your lead flow. I'm bringing in MySalesAI. Can you look at the industry benchmarks for closing ratios in this sector?"  
MySalesAI: "Hi Chase. For your industry, the average close rate is 22%. If you are below that, we usually find the issue is in the 'Nurture' sequence, not the lead quality. I can fix that."  
The Value Drop:  
Marcus: "Chase, this conversation has highlighted three specific leaks in your current model. I've outlined them in an 'Operational Health Audit.' It shows exactly where automation could reclaim about 20 hours of your week. It’s ready for you to review."

## **The Transition to The "Quote"**

Regardless of the path, the ending is the same.

Marcus:  
"I hope you find that report valuable.  
Now, to actually *execute* on that insight, I have designed three engagement models for you. They range from a 'Foundation' build to a 'Full Acceleration' partnership.

Shall I present the options?"
